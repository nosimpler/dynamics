Data handling

\begin_layout Standard
We analyzed the subset (
\begin_inset Formula $n=363)$
\end_inset

 of the ChAT dataset for which eight EEG and four reference channels were
 available for both initial and followup recordings, and where recordings
 were not interrupted mid-session according to clinical notes, further excluding
 three children who were not awake at recording onset according to .
 For each distance measure, we compared distributions of intra-individual
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{AA}=d(A_{baseline},A_{followup})$
\end_inset

 to interindividual distances 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{AB}=d(A_{baseline},B_{followup})$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Those measures for which 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{AA}<D_{AB}$
\end_inset

 measure hypnographic quantities varying less within an individual than
 between individuals, and were considered

\begin_layout Standard
We computed spectral power in each of five classical frequency bands.
 These hypnographic quantities were normalized to unity maximum (
\begin_inset Formula $x/\max x$
\end_inset

) before transforming to logarithmic coordinates; outliers were then removed
 using the kNN distance, and then time-derivatives were estimated with heavy
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=10^{30})$
\end_inset

 total variation regularization.
 The edit distance with real penalty was then computed on the estimated
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{dt}(\log x)=\dot{x}/x$
\end_inset

.
 A distance was thereby assigned between the two recording sessions for
 each individual, channel, and frequency band.
