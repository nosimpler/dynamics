	abstract = {The structure of sleep across the night as expressed by the hypnogram, is characterised by repeated transitions between the different states of vigilance: wake, light and deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This review is concerned with current knowledge on these state transitions, focusing primarily on those ﬁndings that allow the integration of data at cellular level with spectral time-course data at the encephalographic (EEG) level. At the cellular level it has been proposed that, under the inﬂuence of circadian and homeostatic factors, transitions between wake and sleep may be determined by mutually inhibitory interaction between sleep-active neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area and wake-active neurons in multiple arousal centres. These two fundamentally different behavioural states are separated by the sleep onset and the sleep inertia periods each characterised by gradual changes in which neither true wake nor true sleep patterns are present. The results of sequential spectral analysis of EEG data on moves towards and away from deep sleep are related to ﬁndings at the cellular level on the generating mechanisms giving rise to the various NREM oscillatory modes under the neuromodulatory control of brainstem-thalamic activating systems. And there is substantial evidence at cellular level that transition to and from REM sleep is governed by the reciprocal interaction between cholinergic REM-on neurons and aminergic REM-off neurons located in the brainstem. Similarity between the time-course of the REM-on neuronal activity and that of EEG power in the high beta range (w18–30 Hz) allows a tentative parallelism to be drawn between the two. This review emphasises the importance of the thalamically projecting brainstem activating systems in the orchestration of the transitions that give rise to state progression across the sleep–wake cycle.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and arousals are woven into the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation. In the present study, the overnight sleep cycles (SC) of 20 normal subjects were analyzed according to their stage composition, CAP rate, phase A subtypes and arousals. Individual SC were then divided into 10 normalized temporal epochs. CAP parameters and arousals were measured in each epoch and averaged in relation to the SC order. Subtypes A2 and A3 of CAP in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and arousals, both in REM and NREM sleep when not coincident with a A2 or A3 phases, were lumped together as fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activities (FA). Subtypes A1 of CAP, characterized by slow EEG activities (SA), were analyzed separately. The time distribution of SA and FA was compared to the mathematical model of normal sleep structure including functions representing the homeostatic process S, the circadian process C, the ultradian process generating NREM/REM cycles and the slow wave activity (SWA) resulting from the interaction between homeostatic and ultradian processes. The relationship between SA and FA and the sleep-model components was evaluated by multiple regression analysis in which SA and FA were considered as dependent variables while the covariates were the process S, process C, SWA, REM-on and REM-off activities and their squared values. Regression was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) for both SA and FA. SA were prevalent in the first three SC, and exhibited single or multiple peaks immediately before and in the final part of deep sleep (stages 3 + 4). The peaks of FA were delayed and prevailed during the pre-REM periods of light sleep (stages 1 + 2) and during REM sleep. SA showed an exponential decline across the successive SC, according to the homeostatic process. In contrast, the distribution of FA was not influenced by the order of SC, with periodic peaks of FA occurring before the onset of REM sleep, in accordance with the REM-on switch. The dynamics of CAP and arousals during sleep can be viewed as an intermediate level between cellular activities and macroscale EEG phenomena as they reflect the decay of the homeostatic process and the interaction between REM-off and REM-on mechanisms while are slightly influenced by circadian rhythm.},

Signals from C3A2 leads of healthy normal subjects, acquired from polysomnograms obtained from the Sleep Heart Health Study, were analyzed using both Sample Entropy (SaEn) and power spectral analysis (delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency band powers). SaEn changed systematically and significantly (p{\textless}0.001) with sleep state in both age groups, following the relationships W {\textgreater} REM {\textgreater} S2 {\textgreater} S3. SaEn was found to be negatively correlated with delta power and positively correlated with beta power. Small changes in SaEn appear to reflect changes in spectral content rather than changes in regularity of the signal. A better predictor of SaEn than the frequency band powers was the logarithm of the power ratio (alpha+beta)/(delta+theta). Thus, SaEn appears to reflect the balance between sleep-promoting and alertness-promoting mechanisms. SaEn of the elderly was larger than that of middle-aged subjects in S2 (p=0.029) and REM (p=0.001), suggesting that cortical state is shifted towards alertness in elderly subjects in these sleep states compared to middle-aged.},

Standard sleep measures did not predict clinical course. On the other hand, temporal coherence measures discriminated between those who recovered, recovered but recurred, and those who did not recover from the index episode. Speciﬁcally, coherence between β, θ and δ recorded in the right hemisphere was signiﬁcantly lower in the no-recovery group. In addition, temporal coherence was strongly associated with both time to recovery and recurrence. Those with the lowest coherence were less likely to recover or recurred sooner. Signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences were found with a stronger relationship between temporal coherence and clinical course in boys. This study supports the use of quantitative sleep EEG measures as a predictor of clinical course in depression.},

	abstract = {We propose a nonparametric model for time series with missing data based on low-rank matrix factorization. The model expresses each instance in a set of time series as a linear combination of a small number of shared basis functions. Constraining the functions and the corresponding coefficients to be nonnegative yields an interpretable low-dimensional representation of the data. A time-smoothing regularization term ensures that the model captures meaningful trends in the data, instead of overfitting short-term fluctuations. The low-dimensional representation makes it possible to detect outliers and cluster the time series according to the interpretable features extracted by the model, and also to perform forecasting via kernel regression. We apply our methodology to a large real-world dataset of infant-sleep data gathered by caregivers with a mobile-phone app. Our analysis automatically extracts daily-sleep patterns consistent with the existing literature. This allows us to compute sleep-development trends for the cohort, which characterize the emergence of circadian sleep and different napping habits. We apply our methodology to detect anomalous individuals, to cluster the cohort into groups with different sleeping tendencies, and to obtain improved predictions of future sleep behavior.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The pontine nuclei play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. However, pontine ensemble dynamics underlying sleep regulation remain poorly understood. By monitoring population activity in multiple pontine and adjacent brainstem areas, here we show slow, state-predictive pontine ensemble dynamics and state-dependent interactions between the pons and the cortex in mice. On a timescale of seconds to minutes, pontine populations exhibit diverse firing across vigilance states, with some of these dynamics being attributed to cell type-specific activity. Pontine population activity can predict pupil dilation and vigilance states: pontine neurons exhibit longer predictable power compared with hippocampal neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, pontine waves (P-waves) are observed as synchronous firing of pontine neurons primarily during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but also during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Crucially, P-waves functionally interact with cortical activity in a state-dependent manner: during NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) precede P-waves. On the other hand, P-waves during REM sleep are phase-locked with ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations and are followed by burst firing in a subset of hippocampal neurons. Thus, the directionality of functional interactions between the hippocampus and pons changes depending on sleep states. This state-dependent global coordination between pontine and cortical regions implicates distinct functional roles of sleep.},

This is the ﬁrst time that MSE has ever been applied to sleep scoring. All-night polysomnograms from 20 healthy individuals were scored using the Rechtschaffen and Kales rules. The developed method analyzed the EEG signals of C3-A2 for sleep staging. The results of automatic and manual scorings were compared on an epoch-by-epoch basis. A total of 8480 30-s sleep EEG epochs were measured and used for performance evaluation. The epoch-by-epoch comparison was made by classifying the EEG epochs into ﬁve states (Wake/REM/S1/S2/SWS) by the proposed method and manual scoring. The overall sensitivity and kappa coefﬁcient of MSE alone are 76.9\% and 0.65, respectively. Moreover, the overall sensitivity and kappa coefﬁcient of our proposed method of integrating MSE, AR models, and a smoothing process can reach the sensitivity level of 88.1\% and 0.81, respectively. Our results show that MSE is a useful and representative feature for sleep staging. It has high accuracy and good home-care applicability because a single EEG channel is used for sleep staging.},

	abstract = {The conventional approach to the analysis of human sleep uses a set of pre-defined rules to allocate each 20 or 30-s epoch to one of six main sleep stages. The application of these rules is performed either manually, by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram and related signals, or, more recently, by a software implementation of these rules on a computer. This article evaluates the limitations of rule-based sleep staging and then presents a new method of sleep analysis that makes no such use of pre-defined rules and stages, tracking instead the dynamic development of sleep on a continuous scale. The extraction of meaningful features from the electroencephalogram is first considered, and for this purpose a technique called autoregressive modelling was preferred to the more commonly-used methods of band-pass filtering or the fast Fourier transform. This is followed by a qualitative investigation into the dynamics of the electroencephalogram during sleep using a technique for data visualization known as a self-organizing feature map. The insights gained using this map led to the subsequent development of a new, quantitative method of sleep analysis that utilizes the pattern recognition capabilities of an artificial neural network. The outputs from this network provide a second-by-second qualification of the sleep/wakefulness continuum with a resolution that far exceeds that of rule-based sleep staging. This is demonstrated by the neural network's ability to pinpoint micro-arousals and highlight periods of severely disturbed sleep caused by certain sleep disorders. Both these phenomena are of considerable clinical value, but neither are scored satisfactorily using rule-based sleep staging.},

We show that the smooth variation of d system parameters can lead to paths of feature vectors on smooth d-dimensional manifolds in feature space, provided the latter is high-dimensional enough. The number of varying parameters and the nature of their variation can thus be identified. The method is illustrated using numerically generated data and experimental data from electromotors.

However, the functional significance of the temporal dynamics of sleep, manifested in the slow homeostatic process and the alternation between non?rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep remains unclear. We propose that NREM and REM sleep have distinct and complementary contributions to the overall function of sleep. Specifically, we suggest that cortical slow oscillations, occurring within specific functionally interconnected neuronal networks during NREM sleep, enable information processing, synaptic plasticity, and prophylactic cellular maintenance (?recovery process?). In turn, periodic excursions into an activated brain state?REM sleep?appear to be ideally placed to perform ?selection? of brain networks, which have benefited from the process of ?recovery,? based on their offline performance. Such two-stage modus operandi of the sleep process would ensure that its functions are fulfilled according to the current need and in the shortest time possible. Our hypothesis accounts for the overall architecture of normal sleep and opens up new perspectives for understanding pathological conditions associated with abnormal sleep patterns.},

Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neocortical astrocytes while monitoring the activity state of the local neuronal circuit electrophysiologically and optically. We find that astrocytic calcium activity precedes spontaneous circuit shifts to the slow-oscillation–dominated state, a neocortical rhythm characterized by synchronized neuronal firing and important for sleep and memory. Further, we show that optogenetic activation of astrocytes switches the local neuronal circuit to this slow-oscillation state. Finally, using two-photon imaging of extracellular glutamate, we find that astrocytic transients in glutamate co-occur with shifts to the synchronized state and that optogenetically activated astrocytes can generate these glutamate transients. We conclude that astrocytes can indeed trigger the low-frequency state of a cortical circuit by altering extracellular glutamate, and therefore play a causal role in the control of cortical synchronizations.},

	abstract = {The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep/wake cycles in mammals are elusive. In this regulation, at least two mechanisms with fast and slow time scales are involved. In the faster time scale, a state of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep can be microscopically characterized by the millisecond-to-second-order electrical behavior of neurons, namely slow-wave oscillations described by electrophysiology. In the slower time scale, the total duration of NREM sleep is homeostatically regulated by sleep pressure (the need for sleep), which is usually sustained for hours or even days and can be macroscopically described by electroencephalogram (EEG). The longer dynamics of sleep regulation are often explained by the accumulation of sleep-inducing substances (SISs). However, we still do not have a concrete model to connect fast, microscopic dynamics and slow, macroscopic dynamics. In this review, we introduce a recent Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization hypothesis, in which the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization of cortical-membrane potential induces slow-wave oscillation. Slow dynamics of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway might be regulated by recently identiﬁed sleep-promoting kinases as well as classical SISs. Therefore, cortical Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization may be a fundamental mechanism connecting fast neural activity to the slow dynamics of sleep pressure. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {The mammalian claustrum, owing to its widespread connectivity with other forebrain structures, has been hypothesized to mediate functions that range from decision-making to consciousness1. Here we report that a homologue of the claustrum, identified by single-cell transcriptomics and viral tracing of connectivity, also exists in a reptile—the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. In Pogona, the claustrum underlies the generation of sharp waves during slow-wave sleep. The sharp waves, together with superimposed high-frequency ripples2, propagate to the entire neighbouring pallial dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR). Unilateral or bilateral lesions of the claustrum suppress the production of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave sleep in a unilateral or bilateral manner, respectively, but do not affect the regular and rapidly alternating sleep rhythm that is characteristic of sleep in this species3. The claustrum is thus not involved in the generation of the sleep rhythm itself. Tract tracing revealed that the reptilian claustrum projects widely to a variety of forebrain areas, including the cortex, and that it receives converging inputs from, among others, areas of the mid- and hindbrain that are known to be involved in wake–sleep control in mammals4–6. Periodically modulating the concentration of serotonin in the claustrum, for example, caused a matching modulation of sharp-wave production there and in the neighbouring DVR. Using transcriptomic approaches, we also identified a claustrum in the turtle Trachemys scripta, a distant reptilian relative of lizards. The claustrum is therefore an ancient structure that was probably already present in the brain of the common vertebrate ancestor of reptiles and mammals. It may have an important role in the control of brain states owing to the ascending input it receives from the mid- and hindbrain, its widespread projections to the forebrain and its role in sharp-wave generation during slow-wave sleep.},

While the anatomical connectivity from the claustrum to the cortex has been studied intensively, the physiological effect and underlying circuit mechanisms of claustrocortical communication remain elusive. Here we show that the claustrum provides strong, widespread, and long-lasting feedforward inhibition of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) sufﬁcient to silence ongoing neural activity. This claustrocortical feedforward inhibition was predominantly mediated by interneurons containing neuropeptide Y, and to a lesser extent those containing parvalbumin. Therefore, in contrast to other long-range excitatory inputs to the PFC, the claustrocortical pathway is designed to provide overall inhibition of cortical activity. This unique circuit organization allows the claustrum to rapidly and powerfully suppress cortical networks and suggests a distinct role for the claustrum in regulating cognitive processes in prefrontal circuits.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a procedure to analyze and model EEG (electroencephalogram) signal as a time series using ARIMA-GARCH to predict an epileptic attack. The heteroskedasticity of EEG signal is examined through the ARCH or GARCH, (Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) test. The best ARIMA-GARCH model in AIC sense is utilized to measure the volatility of the EEG from epileptic canine subjects, to forecast the future values of EEG. ARIMA-only model can perform prediction but the ARCH or GARCH model acting on the residuals of ARIMA attains a considerable improved forecast horizon. First, we estimate the best ARIMA model, then different orders of ARCH and GARCH modelings are examined to determine the best heteroskedastic model of the residuals of the mentioned ARIMA. Using the simulated conditional variance of selected ARCH or GARCH model, we suggest the procedure to predict the oncoming seizures. The results indicate that GARCH modeling determines the dynamic changes of variance well before the onset of seizure. It can be inferred that the prediction capability comes from the ability of the combined ARIMA-GARCH modeling to cover the heteroskedastic nature of EEG signal changes.},
