\begin_layout Standard
The dynamical structure of sleep can be viewed at several nested timescales

\end_inset

: Circadian rhythms and sleep homeostatic processes act on scales of approximate
ly 24 hours, while ultradian rhythms govern the sleep cycles, whose durations
 vary from approximately 45 minutes in elderly patients with dementia to
 about two hours in children

\end_inset

.
 Below this, the individual bouts of NREM2, NREM3 and REM sleep that comprise
 a sleep cycle have a scale of minutes to tens of minutes [ref.].
 The classical epoch of 20 or 30 seconds corresponds approximately to the
 timescale of stage transitions [ref.], and classical microstructural events
 (individual slow waves, delta oscillations, K-complexes, spindles, theta
 bursts) are on the order of several seconds or less [refs.].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While quantitative models of brain dynamics at the ultradian timescale are
 few (but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "merica_state_2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), a number of statistical models have been proposed to delineate 
\emph on
micro
\emph default
structural events during sleep, among them autoregressive (AR) models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We shall propose here to extend the use of AR models to quantify ultradian
 dynamics, viewing spectral power as a function of epoch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AR models are those of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{t+T}=\sigma+\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}X_{t-nT}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 a sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 the inverse sampling rate, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 a Gaussian noise term.
 A number of extended AR models vary on this basic theme, with moving-average
 (ARMA) and vectorial (VAR) models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 being commonplace.
 While most often used for forecasting [refs.], models in the AR family yield
 a low-dimensional representation of the data in theit coefficients (the

 in so-called

 AR) This makes the coefficients particularly useful as regression and classific
ation variables, and indeed autoregressive coefficients have been used as
 features for neural-network based classification of sleep stage 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and as direct macroarchitectural markers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However, AR models typically require a time-series to be stationary.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "olbrich_dynamics_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, it was argued that the stationarity assumption holds in sleep EEG for
 one-second time windows, i.e.
 at the event timescale, but does not hold at longer scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that in mind, the so-called ARIMA (where 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 stands for 
\emph on
integrated)
\emph default
 models, which are simply ARMA models on a time-differenced signal, can
 ameliorate the stationarity problem.
 The ARIMA model family has been applied to electroencephalography for detecting
 epilepsy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mohamadi_arima-garch_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but to our knowledge it has not been applied to sleep data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because AR coefficients are further tied to spectral estimates by the Wiener-Khi
nchin theorem, our approach here will be twofold: First, we will examine
 the use of ARIMA coefficients to characterize long-timescale (above-epoch
 scale) spectral power time-series during sleep.
 Second, we will use matrix and tensor factorization methods to extract
 structure from AR power spectra in the multichannel/multiband context in
 populations, [[comparing AR power spectra with other spectral models?]].
 We note that nonnegative matrix factorization has recently been applied
 to sleep data

 with some success, and tensor factorization has been applied to discriminate
 sleep patterns in Alzheimer's disease

Data preprocessing

\begin_layout Standard
We analyzed the subset (

\end_inset

 of the ChAT dataset for which eight EEG channels' data were recorded in
 baseline and followup appointments.
 We removed the initial waking period, and computed spectrial power in seven
 frequency bands (normalized to total power at 0.01 to 35Hz).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As quasiperiodic increases in the middle-beta band can be obscured by averaging
 with low-beta 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we [will] split the beta band into two subbands.
