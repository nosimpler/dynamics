	abstract = {The structure of sleep across the night as expressed by the hypnogram, is characterised by repeated transitions between the different states of vigilance: wake, light and deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This review is concerned with current knowledge on these state transitions, focusing primarily on those ﬁndings that allow the integration of data at cellular level with spectral time-course data at the encephalographic (EEG) level. At the cellular level it has been proposed that, under the inﬂuence of circadian and homeostatic factors, transitions between wake and sleep may be determined by mutually inhibitory interaction between sleep-active neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area and wake-active neurons in multiple arousal centres. These two fundamentally different behavioural states are separated by the sleep onset and the sleep inertia periods each characterised by gradual changes in which neither true wake nor true sleep patterns are present. The results of sequential spectral analysis of EEG data on moves towards and away from deep sleep are related to ﬁndings at the cellular level on the generating mechanisms giving rise to the various NREM oscillatory modes under the neuromodulatory control of brainstem-thalamic activating systems. And there is substantial evidence at cellular level that transition to and from REM sleep is governed by the reciprocal interaction between cholinergic REM-on neurons and aminergic REM-off neurons located in the brainstem. Similarity between the time-course of the REM-on neuronal activity and that of EEG power in the high beta range (w18–30 Hz) allows a tentative parallelism to be drawn between the two. This review emphasises the importance of the thalamically projecting brainstem activating systems in the orchestration of the transitions that give rise to state progression across the sleep–wake cycle.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and arousals are woven into the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation. In the present study, the overnight sleep cycles (SC) of 20 normal subjects were analyzed according to their stage composition, CAP rate, phase A subtypes and arousals. Individual SC were then divided into 10 normalized temporal epochs. CAP parameters and arousals were measured in each epoch and averaged in relation to the SC order. Subtypes A2 and A3 of CAP in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and arousals, both in REM and NREM sleep when not coincident with a A2 or A3 phases, were lumped together as fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activities (FA). Subtypes A1 of CAP, characterized by slow EEG activities (SA), were analyzed separately. The time distribution of SA and FA was compared to the mathematical model of normal sleep structure including functions representing the homeostatic process S, the circadian process C, the ultradian process generating NREM/REM cycles and the slow wave activity (SWA) resulting from the interaction between homeostatic and ultradian processes. The relationship between SA and FA and the sleep-model components was evaluated by multiple regression analysis in which SA and FA were considered as dependent variables while the covariates were the process S, process C, SWA, REM-on and REM-off activities and their squared values. Regression was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) for both SA and FA. SA were prevalent in the first three SC, and exhibited single or multiple peaks immediately before and in the final part of deep sleep (stages 3 + 4). The peaks of FA were delayed and prevailed during the pre-REM periods of light sleep (stages 1 + 2) and during REM sleep. SA showed an exponential decline across the successive SC, according to the homeostatic process. In contrast, the distribution of FA was not influenced by the order of SC, with periodic peaks of FA occurring before the onset of REM sleep, in accordance with the REM-on switch. The dynamics of CAP and arousals during sleep can be viewed as an intermediate level between cellular activities and macroscale EEG phenomena as they reflect the decay of the homeostatic process and the interaction between REM-off and REM-on mechanisms while are slightly influenced by circadian rhythm.},

Signals from C3A2 leads of healthy normal subjects, acquired from polysomnograms obtained from the Sleep Heart Health Study, were analyzed using both Sample Entropy (SaEn) and power spectral analysis (delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency band powers). SaEn changed systematically and significantly (p{\textless}0.001) with sleep state in both age groups, following the relationships W {\textgreater} REM {\textgreater} S2 {\textgreater} S3. SaEn was found to be negatively correlated with delta power and positively correlated with beta power. Small changes in SaEn appear to reflect changes in spectral content rather than changes in regularity of the signal. A better predictor of SaEn than the frequency band powers was the logarithm of the power ratio (alpha+beta)/(delta+theta). Thus, SaEn appears to reflect the balance between sleep-promoting and alertness-promoting mechanisms. SaEn of the elderly was larger than that of middle-aged subjects in S2 (p=0.029) and REM (p=0.001), suggesting that cortical state is shifted towards alertness in elderly subjects in these sleep states compared to middle-aged.},

Standard sleep measures did not predict clinical course. On the other hand, temporal coherence measures discriminated between those who recovered, recovered but recurred, and those who did not recover from the index episode. Speciﬁcally, coherence between β, θ and δ recorded in the right hemisphere was signiﬁcantly lower in the no-recovery group. In addition, temporal coherence was strongly associated with both time to recovery and recurrence. Those with the lowest coherence were less likely to recover or recurred sooner. Signiﬁcant sex diﬀerences were found with a stronger relationship between temporal coherence and clinical course in boys. This study supports the use of quantitative sleep EEG measures as a predictor of clinical course in depression.},

	abstract = {We propose a nonparametric model for time series with missing data based on low-rank matrix factorization. The model expresses each instance in a set of time series as a linear combination of a small number of shared basis functions. Constraining the functions and the corresponding coefficients to be nonnegative yields an interpretable low-dimensional representation of the data. A time-smoothing regularization term ensures that the model captures meaningful trends in the data, instead of overfitting short-term fluctuations. The low-dimensional representation makes it possible to detect outliers and cluster the time series according to the interpretable features extracted by the model, and also to perform forecasting via kernel regression. We apply our methodology to a large real-world dataset of infant-sleep data gathered by caregivers with a mobile-phone app. Our analysis automatically extracts daily-sleep patterns consistent with the existing literature. This allows us to compute sleep-development trends for the cohort, which characterize the emergence of circadian sleep and different napping habits. We apply our methodology to detect anomalous individuals, to cluster the cohort into groups with different sleeping tendencies, and to obtain improved predictions of future sleep behavior.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The pontine nuclei play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. However, pontine ensemble dynamics underlying sleep regulation remain poorly understood. By monitoring population activity in multiple pontine and adjacent brainstem areas, here we show slow, state-predictive pontine ensemble dynamics and state-dependent interactions between the pons and the cortex in mice. On a timescale of seconds to minutes, pontine populations exhibit diverse firing across vigilance states, with some of these dynamics being attributed to cell type-specific activity. Pontine population activity can predict pupil dilation and vigilance states: pontine neurons exhibit longer predictable power compared with hippocampal neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, pontine waves (P-waves) are observed as synchronous firing of pontine neurons primarily during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but also during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Crucially, P-waves functionally interact with cortical activity in a state-dependent manner: during NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) precede P-waves. On the other hand, P-waves during REM sleep are phase-locked with ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations and are followed by burst firing in a subset of hippocampal neurons. Thus, the directionality of functional interactions between the hippocampus and pons changes depending on sleep states. This state-dependent global coordination between pontine and cortical regions implicates distinct functional roles of sleep.},

This is the ﬁrst time that MSE has ever been applied to sleep scoring. All-night polysomnograms from 20 healthy individuals were scored using the Rechtschaffen and Kales rules. The developed method analyzed the EEG signals of C3-A2 for sleep staging. The results of automatic and manual scorings were compared on an epoch-by-epoch basis. A total of 8480 30-s sleep EEG epochs were measured and used for performance evaluation. The epoch-by-epoch comparison was made by classifying the EEG epochs into ﬁve states (Wake/REM/S1/S2/SWS) by the proposed method and manual scoring. The overall sensitivity and kappa coefﬁcient of MSE alone are 76.9\% and 0.65, respectively. Moreover, the overall sensitivity and kappa coefﬁcient of our proposed method of integrating MSE, AR models, and a smoothing process can reach the sensitivity level of 88.1\% and 0.81, respectively. Our results show that MSE is a useful and representative feature for sleep staging. It has high accuracy and good home-care applicability because a single EEG channel is used for sleep staging.},

	abstract = {The conventional approach to the analysis of human sleep uses a set of pre-defined rules to allocate each 20 or 30-s epoch to one of six main sleep stages. The application of these rules is performed either manually, by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram and related signals, or, more recently, by a software implementation of these rules on a computer. This article evaluates the limitations of rule-based sleep staging and then presents a new method of sleep analysis that makes no such use of pre-defined rules and stages, tracking instead the dynamic development of sleep on a continuous scale. The extraction of meaningful features from the electroencephalogram is first considered, and for this purpose a technique called autoregressive modelling was preferred to the more commonly-used methods of band-pass filtering or the fast Fourier transform. This is followed by a qualitative investigation into the dynamics of the electroencephalogram during sleep using a technique for data visualization known as a self-organizing feature map. The insights gained using this map led to the subsequent development of a new, quantitative method of sleep analysis that utilizes the pattern recognition capabilities of an artificial neural network. The outputs from this network provide a second-by-second qualification of the sleep/wakefulness continuum with a resolution that far exceeds that of rule-based sleep staging. This is demonstrated by the neural network's ability to pinpoint micro-arousals and highlight periods of severely disturbed sleep caused by certain sleep disorders. Both these phenomena are of considerable clinical value, but neither are scored satisfactorily using rule-based sleep staging.},

The number of varying parameters and the nature of their variation can thus be identified. The method is illustrated using numerically generated data and experimental data from electromotors.

However, the functional significance of the temporal dynamics of sleep, manifested in the slow homeostatic process and the alternation between non?rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep remains unclear. We propose that NREM and REM sleep have distinct and complementary contributions to the overall function of sleep. Specifically, we suggest that cortical slow oscillations, occurring within specific functionally interconnected neuronal networks during NREM sleep, enable information processing, synaptic plasticity, and prophylactic cellular maintenance (?recovery process?). In turn, periodic excursions into an activated brain state?REM sleep?appear to be ideally placed to perform ?selection? of brain networks, which have benefited from the process of ?recovery,? based on their offline performance. Such two-stage modus operandi of the sleep process would ensure that its functions are fulfilled according to the current need and in the shortest time possible. Our hypothesis accounts for the overall architecture of normal sleep and opens up new perspectives for understanding pathological conditions associated with abnormal sleep patterns.},

Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neocortical astrocytes while monitoring the activity state of the local neuronal circuit electrophysiologically and optically. We find that astrocytic calcium activity precedes spontaneous circuit shifts to the slow-oscillation–dominated state, a neocortical rhythm characterized by synchronized neuronal firing and important for sleep and memory. Further, we show that optogenetic activation of astrocytes switches the local neuronal circuit to this slow-oscillation state. Finally, using two-photon imaging of extracellular glutamate, we find that astrocytic transients in glutamate co-occur with shifts to the synchronized state and that optogenetically activated astrocytes can generate these glutamate transients. We conclude that astrocytes can indeed trigger the low-frequency state of a cortical circuit by altering extracellular glutamate, and therefore play a causal role in the control of cortical synchronizations.},

	abstract = {The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep/wake cycles in mammals are elusive. In this regulation, at least two mechanisms with fast and slow time scales are involved. In the faster time scale, a state of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep can be microscopically characterized by the millisecond-to-second-order electrical behavior of neurons, namely slow-wave oscillations described by electrophysiology. In the slower time scale, the total duration of NREM sleep is homeostatically regulated by sleep pressure (the need for sleep), which is usually sustained for hours or even days and can be macroscopically described by electroencephalogram (EEG). The longer dynamics of sleep regulation are often explained by the accumulation of sleep-inducing substances (SISs). However, we still do not have a concrete model to connect fast, microscopic dynamics and slow, macroscopic dynamics. In this review, we introduce a recent Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization hypothesis, in which the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization of cortical-membrane potential induces slow-wave oscillation. Slow dynamics of the Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway might be regulated by recently identiﬁed sleep-promoting kinases as well as classical SISs. Therefore, cortical Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization may be a fundamental mechanism connecting fast neural activity to the slow dynamics of sleep pressure. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {The mammalian claustrum, owing to its widespread connectivity with other forebrain structures, has been hypothesized to mediate functions that range from decision-making to consciousness1. Here we report that a homologue of the claustrum, identified by single-cell transcriptomics and viral tracing of connectivity, also exists in a reptile—the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. In Pogona, the claustrum underlies the generation of sharp waves during slow-wave sleep. The sharp waves, together with superimposed high-frequency ripples2, propagate to the entire neighbouring pallial dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR). Unilateral or bilateral lesions of the claustrum suppress the production of sharp-wave ripples during slow-wave sleep in a unilateral or bilateral manner, respectively, but do not affect the regular and rapidly alternating sleep rhythm that is characteristic of sleep in this species3. The claustrum is thus not involved in the generation of the sleep rhythm itself. Tract tracing revealed that the reptilian claustrum projects widely to a variety of forebrain areas, including the cortex, and that it receives converging inputs from, among others, areas of the mid- and hindbrain that are known to be involved in wake–sleep control in mammals4–6. Periodically modulating the concentration of serotonin in the claustrum, for example, caused a matching modulation of sharp-wave production there and in the neighbouring DVR. Using transcriptomic approaches, we also identified a claustrum in the turtle Trachemys scripta, a distant reptilian relative of lizards. The claustrum is therefore an ancient structure that was probably already present in the brain of the common vertebrate ancestor of reptiles and mammals. It may have an important role in the control of brain states owing to the ascending input it receives from the mid- and hindbrain, its widespread projections to the forebrain and its role in sharp-wave generation during slow-wave sleep.},

While the anatomical connectivity from the claustrum to the cortex has been studied intensively, the physiological effect and underlying circuit mechanisms of claustrocortical communication remain elusive. Here we show that the claustrum provides strong, widespread, and long-lasting feedforward inhibition of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) sufﬁcient to silence ongoing neural activity. This claustrocortical feedforward inhibition was predominantly mediated by interneurons containing neuropeptide Y, and to a lesser extent those containing parvalbumin. Therefore, in contrast to other long-range excitatory inputs to the PFC, the claustrocortical pathway is designed to provide overall inhibition of cortical activity. This unique circuit organization allows the claustrum to rapidly and powerfully suppress cortical networks and suggests a distinct role for the claustrum in regulating cognitive processes in prefrontal circuits.},

The heteroskedasticity of EEG signal is examined through the ARCH or GARCH, (Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) test. The best ARIMA-GARCH model in AIC sense is utilized to measure the volatility of the EEG from epileptic canine subjects, to forecast the future values of EEG. ARIMA-only model can perform prediction but the ARCH or GARCH model acting on the residuals of ARIMA attains a considerable improved forecast horizon. First, we estimate the best ARIMA model, then different orders of ARCH and GARCH modelings are examined to determine the best heteroskedastic model of the residuals of the mentioned ARIMA. Using the simulated conditional variance of selected ARCH or GARCH model, we suggest the procedure to predict the oncoming seizures. The results indicate that GARCH modeling determines the dynamic changes of variance well before the onset of seizure. It can be inferred that the prediction capability comes from the ability of the combined ARIMA-GARCH modeling to cover the heteroskedastic nature of EEG signal changes.},

	abstract = {Little attention has gone into linking to its neuronal substrates the dynamic structure of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, defined as the pattern of time-course power in all frequency bands across an entire episode. Using the spectral power time-courses in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), we showed in the typical first episode, several moves towards-and-away from deep sleep, each having an identical pattern linking the major frequency bands beta, sigma and delta. The neuronal transition probability model (NTP) – in fitting the data well – successfully explained the pattern as resulting from stochastic transitions of the firing-rates of the thalamically-projecting brainstem-activating neurons, alternating between two steady dynamic-states (towards-and-away from deep sleep) each initiated by a so-far unidentified flip-flop. The aims here are to identify this flip-flop and to demonstrate that the model fits well all NREM episodes, not just the first. Using published data on suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) activity we show that the SCN has the information required to provide a threshold-triggered flip-flop for timing the towards-and-away alternations, information provided by sleep-relevant feedback to the SCN. NTP then determines the pattern of spectral power within each dynamic-state. NTP was fitted to individual NREM episodes 1–4, using data from 30 healthy subjects aged 20–30 years, and the quality of fit for each NREM measured. We show that the model fits well all NREM episodes and the best-fit probability-set is found to be effectively the same in fitting all subject data. The significant model-data agreement, the constant probability parameter and the proposed role of the SCN add considerable strength to the model. With it we link for the first time findings at cellular level and detailed time-course data at EEG level, to give a coherent picture of NREM dynamics over the entire night and over hierarchic brain levels all the way from the SCN to the EEG.},

	abstract = {Mammalian sleep alternates between sensory-responsive and protected offline periods via coordinated neural and cardiac rhythms., Rodents sleep in bouts lasting minutes; humans sleep for hours. What are the universal needs served by sleep given such variability? In sleeping mice and humans, through monitoring neural and cardiac activity (combined with assessment of arousability and overnight memory consolidation, respectively), we find a previously unrecognized hallmark of sleep that balances two fundamental yet opposing needs: to maintain sensory reactivity to the environment while promoting recovery and memory consolidation. Coordinated 0.02-Hz oscillations of the sleep spindle band, hippocampal ripple activity, and heart rate sequentially divide non–rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep into offline phases and phases of high susceptibility to external stimulation. A noise stimulus chosen such that sleeping mice woke up or slept through at comparable rates revealed that offline periods correspond to raising, whereas fragility periods correspond to declining portions of the 0.02-Hz oscillation in spindle activity. Oscillations were present throughout non-REM sleep in mice, yet confined to light non-REM sleep (stage 2) in humans. In both species, the 0.02-Hz oscillation predominated over posterior cortex. The strength of the 0.02-Hz oscillation predicted superior memory recall after sleep in a declarative memory task in humans. These oscillations point to a conserved function of mammalian non-REM sleep that cycles between environmental alertness and internal memory processing in 20- to 25-s intervals. Perturbed 0.02-Hz oscillations may cause memory impairment and ill-timed arousals in sleep disorders.},

Physiol Behav 62(3) 585–589, 1997.—Although the time-courses of power in the delta and sigma frequency bands over the NREM episode in the human sleep EEG have been studied for several years, and their detailed forms have been well measured, no mathematical model has yet been formulated to account for the relation between them. The model presented here attempts to explain the form and relative timing of these curves by a consideration of the behavior of the thalamocortical neuronal populations that are believed to play a part in their generation. The model applies the mathematics of the cascade radioactive decay process, adapted to a finite population of thalamocortical neurons oscillating initially in the beta mode. At the beginning of the NREM episode, each neuron of this population is assumed to acquire a constant probability of transitionning to the sigma oscillation mode and, at the same time, each neuron of the newly created sigma population is assumed to acquire a constant probability of transitionning to the delta oscillation mode. This simple model is sufficient to explain the main characteristics of the first half of the time-courses of the sigma and delta powers: the initial positive correlation as they increase together, followed by the sigma peak and the subsequent negative correlation. At the end of this first phase, the model initiates an identical, but reverse, process that reproduces the observed delta maximum and sigma plateau, followed by the concomitant fall of both sigma and delta power. The time-course of the beta power and the overall negative correlation between beta and delta are also reproduced as integral consequences of the model.},

The evolution of each sleep stage within each NREMI REM cycle is presented in detail, showing stage intensities minute by minute. There is a three-phase pattern in each stage intensity diagram: an initial phase of rapid change; a central phase of relative stability; and a terminating phase, again, of rapid change. The details of this pattern change progressively during the night. Throughout all cycles, there is a complementary relationship between the intensities of stage 2 sleep and the other stages that underlines the central role of stage 2 sleep in all stage transitions. Stage intensity diagrams for two groups, one group with and one group without stage 4 sleep, were compared. Subjects without stage 4 sleep tended to have a shorter duration and greater latency of stage 3 sleep. Surprisingly, cycles interrupted by abnormally long periods of continuous wake showed a negative correlation between the intensities of wake and slow wave sleep, and these interruptions did not appear to reset the cycle clock to zero. Sleep stage intensity diagrams may be useful to study the sleep patterns of populations of insomniac and depressive patients, as well as the effect of drugs on sleep.

These studies provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that primary insomnia is associated with hyperarousal of central nervous system and altered sleep homeostasis. However, we have here underlined that these results have intrinsic methodological problems, mainly related to constraints of standard assessment in clinical research. We have proposed that future studies should be performed on larger samples of drug-free patients, using within-subjects designs and longitudinally recording patients adapted to sleep laboratory. All these methodological improvements will allow to partial out the contribution of individual differences, pharmacological influences and first-night effects on EEG frequencies. Moreover, we have discussed the potential relevance of recent findings from basic research concerning local changes during physiological sleep, which could be extended to the study of insomnia. We have suggested that, if normal sleep exhibits specific regional characteristics, also disorders in initiating and maintaining sleep should be characterized by local changes. The extension of this theoretical framework to the study of insomnia could provide new insights on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. As a first step toward the integration of knowledge from basic and clinical research focused on local sleep changes, here we showed some preliminary data from sleep onset recordings of patients with paradoxical insomnia. This approach supports the heuristic potential of our proposal, pointing to a local functional impairment in the process of synchronization in insomniac patients compared to normal subjects, the former exhibiting more beta and less delta and sigma power on anterior scalp locations than the latter.},

The slow sequences of hyperpolarization and depolarization were reflected by slow oscillations in the electroencephalogram. The aim of the present study was to examine whether comparable low-frequency components are present in the human sleep electroencephalogram. All-night sleep recordings from eight healthy young men were subjected to spectral analysis in which the low-frequency attenuation of the amplifier was compensated. During sleep stages with a predominance of slow waves and in the first two episodes of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, the mean power spectrum showed a peak at 0.7–0.8Hz (range 0.55–0.95Hz). The typical decline in delta activity from the first to the second non-rapid-eye-movement sleep episode was not present at frequencies below 2Hz. To detect very low frequency components in the pattern of slow waves and sleep spindles, a new time series was computed from the mean voltage of successive 0.5s epochs of the low-pass ({\textless}4.5Hz) or band-pass (12–15Hz) filtered electroencephalogram. Spectral analysis revealed a periodicity of 20–30s in the prevalence of slow waves and a periodicity of 4s in the occurrence of activity in the spindle frequency range. The results demonstrate that distinct components below 1Hz are also present in the human sleep electroencephalogram spectrum. The differences in the dynamics between the component with a mean peak value at 0.7–0.8Hz and delta waves above 2Hz is in accordance with results from animal experiments.},

	abstract = {EEG slow-wave activity (SWA; spectral power in the 0.75–4.5 Hz band) is a function of the duration of prior waking and, thereby, an indicator of sleep homeostasis. We present a model that accounts for both the declining trend of SWA during sleep and for its variation within the successive nonrapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep episodes. The values of the model parameters were estimated by an optimization procedure in which empirical SWA of baseline nights (16 subjects, 26 nights) served as a reference. A sensitivity analysis revealed the model to be quite robust to small changes (±5\%) of the parameter values. The estimated parameter values were used to simulate data sets from three different experimental protocols (sleep in the evening or sleep in the morning after prolonged waking, or extended sleep initiated at the habitual bedtime;n = 8 or 9). The timing of the REM trigger parameter was derived from the empirical data. A close fit was obtained between the simulated and empirical SWA data, and even the occasional late SWA peaks during extended sleep could be reproduced. Minor discrepancies suggest indirect or direct circadian influences on SWA. The simulations demonstrate that the concept of sleep homeostasis as proposed in the two-process model of sleep regulation can be refined to account in quantitative terms for empirical data and to predict the changes induced by the prolongation of waking or sleep.},

	abstract = {Both period-amplitude analysis (PAA) and power spectral analysis (PSA) were performed on all-night human sleep EEG recordings obtained from 11 subjects. The comparison of the two methods was based on the PAA variables time in band (a wave incidence measure) and rectified amplitude, and on the PSA variables spectral power density and spectral amplitude (the square root of power). The mean time course of these variables was determined for the first 4 nonREM-REM sleep cycles. Spectral power density and spectral amplitude in the delta range were high in nonREM sleep and low in REM sleep, and showed a declining trend over consecutive nonREM sleep episodes. In the frequency range below 2 Hz, rectified amplitude was highly correlated with both time in band and spectral amplitude, and there was no evidence for a dissociation between wave amplitude and wave incidence measures. However, in frequencies above 2 Hz, the modulation of time in band was a mirror image of that below 2 Hz. This result does not reflect a property of the data, but is inherent to the methodology applied. The reversal point of modulation was merely shifted when the high-pass filter settings were changed. It is concluded that band-pass filtering is necessary prior to PAA even for the analysis of the lowest frequency range, and that the indiscriminate use of PAA may give rise to spurious results.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of the sleep EEG were investigated by all-night spectral analysis of 51 sleep records. Power density was calculated for 1-Hz bins in the 0.25–25.0 Hz range. Values in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) were higher than in REMS in the 0.25–16.0 Hz range, and lower in the 18.25–22.0 Hz range. Power density in the 0.25–12.0 Hz range showed a declining trend over the first four NREMS episodes, which, depending on the frequency bin, could be approximated by non-linear or linear decay functions. In the frequency range of sleep spindles (12.25–15.0 Hz), power density in the 13.25–15.0 Hz band showed an increasing trend between NREMS episode 2 and NREMS episode 4. A correlation matrix of 25 1-Hz bins revealed for NREMS a negative correlation between slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.25–4.0 Hz) and activity in the spindle frequency range. This negative correlation was highest in the first NREMS episode and diminished progressively over the subsequent NREMS episodes. Within NREMS episodes, the values in the spindle frequency range showed a U-shaped time course, the trough coinciding with a high level of SWA. By contrast, in both the early and late part of the episode the two types of activity changed in the same direction. The results are consistent with recent electrophysiological studies indicating that the establishment of NREMS is associated with a progressive hyperpolarization of thalamocortical neurons during which the membrane potential exhibits oscillations first in the spindle frequency range and then in the range of SWA.},

	abstract = {The typical declining trend of electroencephalographic (EEG) slow-wave activity (SWA) within a sleep period is represented in the two-process model of sleep regulation by an exponentially decaying process (Process S). The model has been further elaborated to simulate not only the global changes of SWA, but also the dynamics within non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep episodes. In this new model, the initial intraepisodic buildup of SWA is determined by the combined action of an exponentially increasing process and a saturation process, whereas its fall at the end of an episode is due to an exponentially decreasing process. The global declining trend of SWA over consecutive episodes results from the monotonic decay of the intraepisodic saturation level. In contrast to Process S in the two-process model, this decay is not represented by an exponential function, but is proportional to the momentary level of SWA. REM sleep episodes are triggered by an external function. The model allows one to simulate the ultradian pattern of SWA for baseline nights as well as changes induced by a prolonged waking period, a daytime nap, a partial slow-wave sleep deprivation, or an antidepressant drug.},

	abstract = {To investigate the pathophysiology of narcoleptic patients' sleep in detail, we analysed and compared the whole-night polysomnograms of narcoleptic patients and normal human subjects. Eight drug-naive narcoleptic patients and eight age-matched normal volunteers underwent polysomnography (PSG) on two consecutive nights. In addition to conventional visual scoring of the polysomnograms, rapid eye movement (REM)-density and electroencephalograph (EEG) power spectra analyses were also performed. Sleep onset REM periods and fragmented nocturnal sleep were observed as expected in our narcoleptic patients. In the narcoleptic patients, REM period duration across the night did not show the significant increasing trend that is usually observed in normal subjects. In all narcoleptic patient REM periods, eye movement densities were significantly increased. The power spectra of narcoleptic REM sleep significantly increased between 0.3 and 0.9 Hz and decreased between 1.0 and 5.4 Hz. Further analysis revealed that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) period duration and the declining trend of delta power density in the narcoleptic patients were not significantly different from the normal subjects. Compared with normal subjects, the power spectra of narcoleptic NREM sleep increased in the 1.0–1.4 Hz and 11.0–11.9 Hz frequency bands, and decreased in a 24.0–26.9 Hz frequency band. Thus, increased EEG delta and decreased beta power densities were commonly observed in both the NREM and REM sleep of the narcoleptic patients, although the decrease in beta power during REM sleep was not statistically significant. Our visual analysis revealed fragmented nocturnal sleep and increased phasic REM components in the narcoleptic patients, which suggest the disturbance of sleep maintenance mechanism(s) and excessive effects of the mechanism(s) underlying eye movement activities during REM sleep in narcolepsy. Spectral analysis revealed significant increases in delta components and decreases in beta components, which suggest decreased activity in central arousal mechanisms. These characteristics lead us to hypothesize that two countervailing mechanisms underlie narcoleptic sleep pathology.},

We therefore performed simultaneous ambulatory polysomnography and wrist-activity monitoring (AM) in 14 healthy male subjects without sleep complaints. In this context, a simple method for transforming raw motor activity data into a time-series reflecting onset and duration of activity and immobility clusters is introduced. Our results demonstrate that nocturnal AM measures were significantly affected by sleep stage. Low activity levels and particularly prolonged episodes of uninterrupted immobility were associated with increasing sleep depth. On the other hand, high activity levels and prolonged episodes of activity were related to intermittent wakefulness during sleep. Our results suggest that measures reflecting the occurrence and duration of activity and immobility clusters provide a better approach in studying the relationship between activity/immobility and sleep stages. Except for the duration of uninterrupted immobility episodes, which showed a significant decrease in the fourth cycle, none of the AM measures showed a significant cycle-to-cycle variation. Consequently, mean nocturnal motor activity measures provide an accurate reflection of the total sleep period. However, none of the AM-derived measures seems useful in evaluating the cycle structure during sleep.},

	abstract = {The sleep EEG undergoes many changes during adolescence. We assessed whether sleep homeostasis is altered across adolescent development using two measures: the dissipation of slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.6 to 4.6 Hz) across the night and the rate of build-up of SWA in the first NREM sleep episode. Furthermore, we examined the association between homeostatic and circadian measures, by correlating the build-up of SWA in the first NREM sleep episode with circadian phase. Finally, we compared the dissipation of SWA in individuals with (PH+) and without (PH-) a parental history of alcohol abuse/dependence. Twenty children (8 PH+) and twenty-five teens (10 PH+) underwent two consecutive polysomnographic recordings at ages 9/10 and 15/16 years and again 1.5 to 3 years later. Thirteen young adults (ages 20 to 23; no PH+) were assessed one time. The decay of Process S was modeled for each individual at each assessment using data from both recordings. Four parameters of Process S were derived for EEG derivation C3/A2: time constant of the decay, lower asymptote (LA), the level of S at sleep onset (SSO), and SSO minus LA. We found no change in these parameters between assessments for the children and teen cohorts. Between-subjects analysis of the follow-up assessment for children (ages 11-13) and the initial assessment for teens (ages 15/16) showed no difference in these parameters, nor did follow-up assessment of teens (ages 17-19) compared to the single assessment of young adults (ages 20-23). Similarly, we observed no developmental changes in the rate of the build-up of SWA in the first NREM sleep episode for our within- and between-subjects analyses, or a correlation between this measure and circadian phase for either cohort. With regards to parental alcohol history, we found no difference in the dissipation of sleep pressure between PH+ and PH- children and teens. These results indicate that the dissipation of sleep pressure does not change across adolescent development, is not correlated to circadian phase, and does not differ between PH+ and PH- children and teens.},

Each ofthese four manipulations was followed by a day-time sleep beginning at 1100 hr. No significant changes in the duration of the first sleep cycle appeared. As the prior sleep loss increased both SWE (slow-wave energy; accumulated EEG delta power density) and SWA (slow-wave activity; EEG delta power per minute) increased during the IlOO-hr sleeps. This was observed for the entire cycles, the nonrapid eye movement (NREM) periods, and the SWS periods, respectively. SWS latency decreased and SWS duration increased, respectively, markedly with prior waking. Also, for the progressively postponed sleeps (started at 2300 hr, 0300 hr, 0500 hr and 1100 hr) there were changes, but not as clear. After 28 hr of continuous waking there was a marked increase ofSWA during SWS. Also, at this level there was a spill over of SWA to the second cycle. It is suggested that there might be a limit to the amount and intensity of SWS that can be accommodated in the first sleep cycle and that this limit is reached before the appearance of REM sleep.},

	abstract = {Human sleep episodes are characterized by an approximately 90-minute ultradian oscillation between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep stages. The source of this oscillation is not known. Pacemaker mechanisms for this rhythm have been proposed, such as a reciprocal interaction network, but these fail to account for documented homeostatic regulation of both sleep stages. Here, two candidate mechanisms are investigated using a simple model that has stable states corresponding to Wake, REM sleep, and NREM sleep. Unlike other models of the ultradian rhythm, this model of sleep dynamics does not include an ultradian pacemaker, nor does it invoke a hypothetical homeostatic process that exists purely to drive ultradian rhythms. Instead, only two inputs are included: the homeostatic drive for Sleep and the circadian drive for Wake. These two inputs have been the basis for the most influential Sleep/Wake models, but have not previously been identified as possible ultradian rhythm generators. Using the model, realistic ultradian rhythms are generated by arousal state feedback to either the homeostatic or circadian drive. For the proposed ‘homeostatic mechanism’, homeostatic pressure increases in Wake and REM sleep, and decreases in NREM sleep. For the proposed ‘circadian mechanism’, the circadian drive is up-regulated in Wake and REM sleep, and is down-regulated in NREM sleep. The two mechanisms are complementary in the features they capture. The homeostatic mechanism reproduces experimentally observed rebounds in NREM sleep duration and intensity following total sleep deprivation, and rebounds in both NREM sleep intensity and REM sleep duration following selective REM sleep deprivation. The circadian mechanism does not reproduce sleep state rebounds, but more accurately reproduces the temporal patterns observed in a normal night of sleep. These findings have important implications in terms of sleep physiology and they provide a parsimonious explanation for the observed ultradian rhythm of REM/NREM sleep.},

It was based on a carefully selected group of healthy control subjects whose sleep was polysomnographically recorded at home for 4 sequential nights. The latency of REM sleep was inversely correlated with the number of cycles and positively correlated with the mean cycle duration, both in individual nights and on means of 4 nights. The present study demonstrated that variations in the number of cycles or the mean cycle duration between the nights are far less important than the substantial differences observed between subjects. Present outcomes support the study of sleep cycle periods and frequencies in those psychiatric disorders where REM sleep latencies have been found to be shorter, and they suggest that these variables be included in sleep studies in which cycles are compared with each other.},

It is also an important topic for psychiatric research, since both sleep components show anomalies in Major Depressive Disorders (MDD) and related syndromes. In previous studies on healthy controls, we showed preferential links of the number of ultradian cycles with REMS-related variables rather than with NREMS-related variables. REMS Latency (RL), for example, was shown to be inversely related to the number of cycles. The present study replicates these analyses in a group of 29 patients with MDD (age range: 23–56; 16 females), after two adaptation nights. Results showed significant correlations between the number of cycles and REMS, and between the number of cycles and RL, whereas correlations with NREMS were not significant. This indirectly supports regulation hypotheses considering REMS as the main focus of the oscillation, inhibiting and interrupting NREMS. Also, when the RL is shorter, there are more ultradian cycles than when the RL is long. This adds an interesting element in the elucidation of the physiological meaning of anomalies of RL.},

The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers based on EEG power values and spindle characteristics during sleep that occur in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults., Methods: This study was a case-control cross-sectional study with 1-year follow-up of cases. Patients with isolated subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) or MCI were recruited in the Bordeaux Memory Clinic (MEMENTO cohort). Cognitively normal controls were recruited. All participants were recorded with two successive polysomnography 1 year apart. Delta, theta, and sigma absolute spectral power and spindle characteristics (frequency, density, and amplitude) were analyzed from purified EEG during NREM and REM sleep periods during the entire second night., Results: Twenty-nine patients (8 males, age = 71 ± 7 years) and 29 controls were recruited at T0. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that age-related cognitive impairment were associated with a reduced delta power (odds ratio (OR) 0.072, P {\textless} 0.05), theta power (OR 0.018, P {\textless} 0.01), sigma power (OR 0.033, P {\textless} 0.05), and spindle maximal amplitude (OR 0.002, P {\textless} 0.05) during NREM sleep. Variables were adjusted on age, gender, body mass index, educational level, and medication use. Seventeen patients were evaluated at 1-year follow-up. Correlations showed that changes in self-reported sleep complaints, sleep consolidation, and spindle characteristics (spectral power, maximal amplitude, duration, and frequency) were associated with cognitive impairment (P {\textless} 0.05)., Conclusion: A reduction in slow-wave, theta and sigma activities, and a modification in spindle characteristics during NREM sleep are associated very early with a greater risk of the occurrence of cognitive impairment. Poor sleep consolidation, lower amplitude, and faster frequency of spindles may be early sleep biomarkers of worsening cognitive decline in older adults.},

We noted frequency increases in δ-waves in sleep-deprived (SD) mice, prompting us to re-evaluate how slow-wave characteristics relate to prior sleep-wake history. We discovered two types of δ-waves; one responding to SD with high initial power and fast, discontinuous decay (δ2: {\textasciitilde}2.5-3.5Hz) and another unrelated to time-spentawake with slow, linear decays (δ1: {\textasciitilde}0.75-1.75Hz). Human experiments confirmed this δ-band heterogeneity. Similar to SD, silencing of centromedial thalamus neurons boosted δ2- waves, specifically. δ2-dynamics paralleled that of temperature, muscle tone, heart-rate, and neuronal UP/DOWN state lengths, all reverting to characteristic NREMS levels within the first recovery hour. Thus, prolonged waking seems to necessitate a physiological recalibration before typical NREMS can be reinstated. These short-lasting δ2-dynamics challenge accepted models of sleep regulation and function based on the merged δ-band as sleep-need proxy.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and arousals are woven into the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation. In the present study, the overnight sleep cycles (SC) of 20 normal subjects were analyzed according to their stage composition, CAP rate, phase A subtypes and arousals. Individual SC were then divided into 10 normalized temporal epochs. CAP parameters and arousals were measured in each epoch and averaged in relation to the SC order. Subtypes A2 and A3 of CAP in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and arousals, both in REM and NREM sleep when not coincident with a A2 or A3 phases, were lumped together as fast electroencephalographic (EEG) activities (FA). Subtypes A1 of CAP, characterized by slow EEG activities (SA), were analyzed separately. The time distribution of SA and FA was compared to the mathematical model of normal sleep structure including functions representing the homeostatic process S, the circadian process C, the ultradian process generating NREM/REM cycles and the slow wave activity (SWA) resulting from the interaction between homeostatic and ultradian processes. The relationship between SA and FA and the sleep-model components was evaluated by multiple regression analysis in which SA and FA were considered as dependent variables while the covariates were the process S, process C, SWA, REM-on and REM-off activities and their squared values. Regression was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) for both SA and FA. SA were prevalent in the first three SC, and exhibited single or multiple peaks immediately before and in the final part of deep sleep (stages 3 + 4). The peaks of FA were delayed and prevailed during the pre-REM periods of light sleep (stages 1 + 2) and during REM sleep. SA showed an exponential decline across the successive SC, according to the homeostatic process. In contrast, the distribution of FA was not influenced by the order of SC, with periodic peaks of FA occurring before the onset of REM sleep, in accordance with the REM-on switch. The dynamics of CAP and arousals during sleep can be viewed as an intermediate level between cellular activities and macroscale EEG phenomena as they reflect the decay of the homeostatic process and the interaction between REM-off and REM-on mechanisms while are slightly influenced by circadian rhythm.},

In this paper we make use of KNMF to extract discriminative spectral features from the time–frequency representation of electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which is an important task in EEG classiﬁcation. Especially when KNMF with linear kernel is used, spectral features are easily computed by a matrix multiplication, while in the standard NMF multiplicative update should be performed repeatedly with the other factor matrix ﬁxed, or the pseudo-inverse of a matrix is required. Moreover in KNMF with linear kernel, one can easily perform feature selection or data selection, because of its sparsity nature.

	abstract = {Owing to the use of scalp electrodes in human sleep recordings, cortical EEG signals are inevitably intermingled with the electrical activity of the muscle tissue on the skull. Muscle artifacts are characterized by surges in high frequency activity and are readily identified because of their outlying high values relative to the local background activity. To detect bursts of myogenic activity a simple algorithm is introduced that compares high frequency activity (26.25–32.0 Hz) in each 4-s epoch with the activity level in a local 3-min window. A 4-s value was considered artifactual if it exceeded the local background activity by a certain factor. Sensitivity and specificity of the artifact detection algorithm were empirically adjusted by applying different factors as artifact thresholds. In an analysis of sleep EEG signals recorded from 25 healthy young adults 2.3\% (SEM: 0.16) of all 4-s epochs during sleep were identified as artifacts when a threshold factor of four was applied. Contamination of the EEG by muscle activity was more frequent towards the end of non-REM sleep episodes when EEG slow wave activity declined. Within and across REM sleep episodes muscle artifacts were evenly distributed. When the EEG signal was cleared of muscle artifacts, the all-night EEG power spectrum showed significant reductions in power density for all frequencies from 0.25–32.0 Hz. Between 15 and 32 Hz, muscle artifacts made up a substantial part (20–70\%) of all-night EEG power density. It is concluded that elimination of short-lasting muscle artifacts reduces the confound between cortical and myogenic activity and is important in interpreting quantitative EEG data. Quantitative approaches in defining and detecting transient events in the EEG signal may help to determine which EEG phenomena constitute clinically significant arousals.},

Twenty-six insomniac and 28 control nights were studied in a discriminant analysis to determine whether this transitional state is modified in any way in subjects diagnosed for psychophysiological insomnia. A discriminant function was derived based on 20 insomniac and 22 normal nights. All 42 nights were correctly classified by this function. The sleep onset period, extending on the average over about 3 minutes, was characterized essentially by the beta and delta components of the EEG signal and by an activity index given by the ratio beta/delta, measured at the temporal lobe sites. Other variables included the subject's age and the magnitude of the changes occurring in the difference between activities in the right and left hemispheres. The variables contributing most to the discrimination were the activity index and beta, especially at the transitions from wake to stage 1 and from stage 1 to stage 2. The contribution of delta to the discrimination was less, but extended further in time to include stage 2 sleep. A test on the remaining six insomniac and six control nights gave a 75\% classification accuracy, thus validating the derived discriminant function.},

	abstract = {Previous work from our laboratory has shown that aspirin leads to a significant reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS). Recently, it has been hypothesized that this might be linked to alterations in body temperature around sleep onset, and during the preceding wakefulness. We report unpublished findings from an earlier aspirin and sleep study that help to address this issue. Seventeen healthy subjects took their oral temperature on an hourly basis throughout wakefulness, during 5 baseline days, 4 days on drug or placebo, and 3 recovery days. A dose of 600 mg of aspirin three times a day led to a small but significant fall in oral temperature in both men and women. The circadian temperature trends over the waking day remained unaltered. The relevance of these findings to SWS changes was discussed. Key Words: Aspirin-Human body temperature-Circadian rhythm-Sleep-SWS.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate quantitatively the effect of data gaps for four methods of estimating the amplitude spectrum of a time series: fast Fourier transform (FFT), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), Z transform (ZTR) and the Lomb–Scargle algorithm (LST). We devise two tests: the single-large-gap test, which can probe the effect of a single data gap of varying size and the multiple-small-gaps test, used to study the effect of numerous small gaps of variable size distributed within the time series. The tests are applied on two data sets: a synthetic data set composed of a superposition of four sinusoidal modes, and one component of the magnetic ﬁeld measured by the Venus Express (VEX) spacecraft in orbit around the planet Venus. For single data gaps, FFT and DFT give an amplitude monotonically decreasing with gap size. However, the shape of their amplitude spectrum remains unmodiﬁed even for a large data gap. On the other hand, ZTR and LST preserve the absolute level of amplitude but lead to greatly increased spectral noise for increasing gap size. For multiple small data gaps, DFT, ZTR and LST can, unlike FFT, ﬁnd the correct amplitude of sinusoidal modes even for large data gap percentage. However, for in-situ data collected in a turbulent plasma environment, these three methods overestimate the high frequency part of the amplitude spectrum above a threshold depending on the maximum gap size, while FFT slightly underestimates it.},

Linking specific, universal, and regularly occurring stages of sleep with dreaming encourages the direct and systematic investigation of a topic that has fascinated humankind for centuries. In this review, we explore to what extent individuals dream during periods of rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep, and we introduce research on lucid dreaming. We then discuss how dreaming during different stages of sleep varies in terms of phenomenological characteristics, and to what extent individuals are conscious throughout the sleep cycle. Finally, we provide a synopsis of the previous literature on brain activity during sleep, and we aim to clarify how the neurofunctional changes observed throughout sleep may lead to changes in phenomenological aspects of dreams, and in the domain of consciousness.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.63.021903},
	abstract = {A recent neurophysical model of propagation of electrical waves in the cortex is extended to include a physiologically motivated subcortical feedback loop via the thalamus. The electroencephalographic spectrum when the system is driven by white noise is then calculated analytically in terms of physiological parameters, including the effects of filtering of signals by the cerebrospinal fluid, skull, and scalp. The spectral power at low frequencies is found to vary as f(-1) when awake and f(-3) when asleep, with a breakpoint to a steeper power-law tail at frequencies above about 20 Hz in both cases; the f(-1) range concurs with recent magnetoencephalographic observations of such a regime. Parameter sensitivities are explored, enabling a model with fewer free parameters to be proposed, and showing that spectra predicted for physiologically reasonable parameter values strongly resemble those observed in the laboratory. Alpha and beta peaks seen near 10 Hz and twice that frequency, respectively, in the relaxed wakeful state are generated via subcortical feedback in this model, thereby leading to predictions of their frequencies in terms of physiological parameters, and of correlations in their occurrence. Subcortical feedback is also predicted to be responsible for production of anticorrelated peaks in deep sleep states that correspond to the occurrence of theta rhythm at around half the alpha frequency and sleep spindles at 3/2 times the alpha frequency. An additional positively correlated waking peak near three times the alpha frequency is also predicted and tentatively observed, as are two new types of sleep spindle near 5/2 and 7/2 times the alpha frequency, and anticorrelated with alpha. These results provide a theoretical basis for the conventional division of EEG spectra into frequency bands, but imply that the exact bounds of these bands depend on the individual. Three types of potential instability are found: one at zero frequency, another in the theta band at around half the alpha frequency, and a third at the alpha frequency itself.},

	abstract = {Hcrt gene inactivation in mice leads to behavioral state instability, abnormal transitions to paradoxical sleep, and cataplexy, hallmarks of narcolepsy. Sleep homeostasis is, however, considered unimpaired in patients and narcoleptic mice. We find that whereas Hcrtko/ko mice respond to 6-h sleep deprivation (SD) with a slow-wave sleep (SWS) EEG δ (1.0 to 4.0 Hz) power rebound like WT littermates, spontaneous waking fails to induce a δ power reflecting prior waking duration. This correlates with impaired θ (6.0 to 9.5 Hz) and fast-γ (55 to 80 Hz) activity in prior waking. We algorithmically identify a theta-dominated wakefulness (TDW) substate underlying motivated behaviors and typically preceding cataplexy in Hcrtko/ko mice. Hcrtko/ko mice fully implement TDW when waking is enforced, but spontaneous TDW episode duration is greatly reduced. A reformulation of the classic sleep homeostasis model, where homeostatic pressure rises exclusively in TDW rather than all waking, predicts δ power dynamics both in Hcrtko/ko and WT mouse baseline and recovery SWS. The low homeostatic impact of Hcrtko/ko mouse spontaneous waking correlates with decreased cortical expression of neuronal activity-related genes (notably Bdnf, Egr1/Zif268, and Per2). Thus, spontaneous TDW stability relies on Hcrt to sustain θ/fast-γ network activity and associated plasticity, whereas other arousal circuits sustain TDW during SD. We propose that TDW identifies a discrete global brain activity mode that is regulated by context-dependent neuromodulators and acts as a major driver of sleep homeostasis. Hcrt loss in Hcrtko/ko mice causes impaired TDW maintenance in baseline wake and blunted δ power in SWS, reproducing, respectively, narcolepsy excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality.},

	abstract = {Sleep spindle generation classically relies on an interplay between the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), thalamo-cortical (TC) relay cells and cortico-thalamic (CT) feedback during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindles are hypothesized to stabilize sleep, gate sensory processing and consolidate memory. However, the contribution of non-sensory thalamic nuclei in spindle generation and the role of spindles in sleep-state regulation remain unclear. Using multisite thalamic and cortical LFP/unit recordings in freely behaving mice, we show that spike-field coupling within centromedial and anterodorsal (AD) thalamic nuclei is as strong as for TRN during detected spindles. We found that spindle rate significantly increases before the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but not wakefulness. The latter observation is consistent with our finding that enhancing spontaneous activity of TRN cells or TRN-AD projections using optogenetics increase spindle rate and transitions to REM sleep. Together, our results extend the classical TRN-TC-CT spindle pathway to include non-sensory thalamic nuclei and implicate spindles in the onset of REM sleep.},

	abstract = {Air traffic control voice (i.e., utterance) transcript data are often underutilized in the context of airspace analysis, despite its increasing availability. This underuse provides an opportunity for enhanced analysis, as utterances contain operational directives which are typically inferred from aircraft trajectories. Direct knowledge of such directives would facilitate various activities such as Area Navigation (RNAV) procedure assessment, airspace redesign, or controller workload studies. Though transcribed utterances can be free-form, they fit into a finite number of categories. To this end, we propose using domain knowledge to create an effective warm-start strategy for the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which in turn can be used to categorize utterance transcripts automatically. Using human and machine transcribed voice data, we show that our approach closely matches manually labeled (i.e., by subject matter experts) utterances. Furthermore, we associate labeled utterances to their corresponding trajectories and propose a novel procedure analysis methodology via geospatial utterance “heatmaps.”.},
